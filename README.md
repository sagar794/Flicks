# Project 2 - Flicks

Flicks is a movies app displaying box office and top rental DVDs using [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: 8 hour spent in total 

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] User can view movie details by tapping on a cell.
- [X] User can select from a tab bar for either **Now Playing** or **Top Rated** movies.
- [X] Customize the selection effect of the cell.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] For the large poster, load the low resolution image first and then switch to the high resolution image when complete.
- [X] Customize the navigation bar.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] After selecting a cell, a user can view the trailer of the movie by pulling down the screen

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. What could've been a better way to implement the trailer?
2. I could't find a pod for a pull down arrow so I just resorted to adding a UILabel telling the user to pull the screen down to view the trailer.

## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:
